## PHP Library for the Omnicasa API

[Omnicasa](http://www.omnicasa.com/) is an application for real estate agencies to manage properties.

For one of our clients we created a website and build this library to utilize their API.

### Usage

Check out the examples folder.

While the API provides both XML and JSON output, the library currently only supports JSON.

**Note:** the api is not publicly available (you need a username and password) and access is restricted to IP.
